When reporting an issue, please include:

- A detailed description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue, if possible.
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or code snippets.

We will acknoledge your report within **48 hours** an provide an estimated timeline for addressing the issue. Your
efforts in making our project more secure are greatly appreciated!

## Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible disclosure and will work with you to ensure that any vulnerability is resolved in a timely and
transparent manner. If you adhere to responsible disclosure practices, we will gladly acknowledge your contribution in
our release notes or security updates.
