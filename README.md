# 👨‍💻 Welcome to my GitHub profile! 🚀

I'm an IT apprentice with a strong passion for all things tech. I'm on a mission to automate the world! 🌍⚡️ 
My **specialty**? Automating everything I can with tools like **Docker**, **Ansible**, and **Terraform**. If it can be 
automated, it **will** be! 😉

### 🚀 My Skills
- **Docker**: Containerizing all the things! 🐳
- **Ansible**: Automating tasks like a pro (or at least trying to 😄) 🛠️
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code... because typing commands manually is sooo last decade! 🌱

### 🔧 What I'm up to
- Automating my life (or at least my IT systems) 🖥️
- Breaking and fixing things (in that order) 🛠️
- Learning and growing with every line of code 📚

### 🌱 I’m currently learning
- How to automate the coffee machine... next step: world domination ☕🤖
- More about scaling infrastructure and making everything 'infinitely' scalable (is that even possible?) ⚡️

Feel free to check out my repositories and join me on this automation journey! 🔥
